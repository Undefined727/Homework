An answer is rarely achieved in under 20 guesses regardless of the theory while using RandomClue.
This strategy is bad, as randomly guessing doesn't use the clues or rely on previous wrong solutions.

The driver I created, RandomCluev2, always guesses with a maximum limit of 20.
The strategy it uses cycles through one of the three variables whenever said variable is shown to be false.
Cycling through every variable in the method I used has a maximum of 20, as besides the initial state (1), there are 9 possible locations to cycle through, 5 possible weapons, and 5 people.
